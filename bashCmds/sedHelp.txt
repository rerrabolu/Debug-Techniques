Using 'sed' to process a file:

  https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html
  sed treats multiple input files as one long stream
  To process a file for multiple patterns, simply run
  sed again using Pipe
  
  # Launch syntax
  sed SCRIPT INPUTFILE

  # Place script in a file
  sed -f <file-with-sed-script> <input-stream> > <output-stream>
  
  # Substitute one string with another
  sed 's/hello/world/' <input-stream> > <output-stream>
  
  # Delete lines with given expression
  sed '/<pattern-1>/d' > <output-stream>

  # Substitute or Delete multiple patterns
  sed <first-pattern-script> < <input-stream> |
    sed <second-pattern-script> |
    sed <third-pattern-script> > <output-stream>
