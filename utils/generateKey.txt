Steps to Generate GPG Key

1. Run the command: gpg --gen-key

2. Choose default values for:
     kind of key 
     size of key
     life of key
3. Confirm choices to apply

4. Configure Name and Email fields
     Name:FirstName LastName
     Email:userId@orgId.domainId
     @note 1: Make sure Name and Email matches values from remote machine
     @note 2: Leave Comment field empty (default value)

5. Enter a alpha-numeric as password, confirm the same value

6. Most likely the key generation process will complain about not having sufficient random bytes to use

7. In a separate shell cat a file in a loop until the key generation completes
     e.g. <shell_prompt> for stream in {1..23} do cat <someTextFile> done
