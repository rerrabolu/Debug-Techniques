For a memory write transatcion the bandwidth between any two PCIe devices
is affected by the system parameter Maximum Payload Size - MPS. The lowest
value on the path determines the binding value that is used in a transaction
One can query the MPS of a device as follows:

This was obtained from following URL:
  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/429512/how-can-i-query-the-pci-maxpayloadsize-that-was-negotiated-at-boot

// Do no recommend this command
#<shell-prompt> sudo lspci -vv |grep -P '^\d|Payload'

# Recommend this command to execute
<shell-prompt> sudo lspci -vv 2>&1 | tee <someLogFile.txt>

Look at the value reported under DevCtl and DevCap sections of a device. It
reports the value that is currently bound i.e. is being used versus capability
of the device. DevCtl is live, DevCap is what is possible

		DevCap:	MaxPayload 256 bytes, PhantFunc 0, Latency L0s <4us, L1 unlimited
			ExtTag+ AttnBtn- AttnInd- PwrInd- RBE+ FLReset- SlotPowerLimit 0.000W
		DevCtl:	Report errors: Correctable- Non-Fatal- Fatal- Unsupported-
			RlxdOrd+ ExtTag+ PhantFunc- AuxPwr- NoSnoop+
			MaxPayload 256 bytes, MaxReadReq 512 bytes
