When doing a memory Read, the bandwidth is affected by a system parameter
called Root Completion Boundary (RCB). This is something that is specified
by PCIe specification to be 64 or 128 bytes. This value is bound by Root Complex
and is used to configure end-point devices as well. You can find this value in the
end point's LnkCtl field.

RCB specifies how data for a read request shoud be returned and includes
address alignment. For example requesting 512 bytes from two different
addresses a1 and a2 impacts as to how many Transaction Layer Packets are
used to send the data. This is because each  packet has a maximum size that
is specified by RCB plus an address alignment requirement

Following is a log from a lspci command that shows it

// Do no recommend this command
#<shell-prompt> sudo lspci -vv |grep 'LnkCtl:'

# Recommend this command to execute
<shell-prompt> sudo lspci -vv 2>&1 | tee <someLogFile.txt>

Look at the value reported under LnkCtl section of a device. It reports the value
that is currently bound i.e. is being used versus capability of the device. LnkCtl
is live, LnkCap is what is possible

		LnkCap:	Port #0, Speed 8GT/s, Width x16, ASPM L0s L1, Exit Latency L0s <64ns, L1 <1us
			ClockPM- Surprise- LLActRep- BwNot- ASPMOptComp+
		LnkCtl:	ASPM Disabled; RCB 64 bytes Disabled- CommClk+
