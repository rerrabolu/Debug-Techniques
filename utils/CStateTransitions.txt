Disabling C-State Transitions:

One way to manage power is to transition CPU to lower power states when
they are in Idle mode.

You can read more on this feature.

The following can be executed to disable C-state transitions to study its
impact on performance measurements. It is important to note that the commands
to write to latency file require sudo privileges. The command sequence listed
below is one way to achieve this.

The same is available as a script: ctrlCState.bash

#
# Specify the name of executable to run
#
NameOfExe="Name of executable file including path"

#
# Open Cpu Latency Control file and set desired C-state level
#
cpuLatency=/dev/cpu_dma_latency
exec 33> $cpuLatency
echo 0 >&33

#
# Print run parameters before launching application
#
if [ "$#" -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "NameOfExe Run Params: $@"
fi
$NameOfExe "$@"

#
# Close Cpu Latency Control file
#
exec 33>&-
