One can use objdump to get the symbols of a library, perhaps even an
executable. Lookup the man page for objdump. I used it to dump out the
various functions of ROCm Runtime library - ROCr. The command to execute
to get the list of functions is:

  objdump -d "library-name"

This will dump out a lot of information. One must parse this output to look
for lines that end with a semi-colon and has some unique string associated
with information you are looking for. Since the interest was to look for lines
that has "hsa", it was used to grep out those lines and ensure they also
include a semi-colon. Three lines of this processed output is given below for
reference:

  000000000006dadc <_ZN4rocr3HSA8hsa_initEv>:
  000000000006db20 <_ZN4rocr3HSA13hsa_shut_downEv>:
  000000000006db77 <_ZN4rocr3HSA19hsa_system_get_infoE17hsa_system_info_tPv>:
