Command to List packages Installed on a System:
  dpkg -l | awk '/^[hi]i/{print $2}'
  
Build & Remove ABCd Packages From a System:

  Assume this software stack has packages in user and kernel domains

  Construct a list of these pacakges as follows interactively or via script
  The commands below illustrate packages starting names. Substitute them
  with appropriate names for ABCd software stack:
  
    export krnlList=`dpkg -l | awk '/^[hi]i/{print $2}' | grep ^kabc`
    export abcList=`dpkg -l | awk '/^[hi]i/{print $2}' | grep ^abc`
    export ijkList=`dpkg -l | awk '/^[hi]i/{print $2}' | grep ^ijk`
    export pqrList=`dpkg -l | awk '/^[hi]i/{print $2}' | grep ^pqr`

  Verify that the various debian packages are actually ABCd related and
  therefore are candidates for removal. For each each element of each list
  run the command that removes the package completely:
  
    sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove <package-name>

  Remove any orphan packages tha are left upon removal of all ABCd packages.
  Orphan packages are those packages that have been installed to satisfy
  dependencies of a package. For example abcd-ijk package may dependend
  upon "abcd-pqr-dev". So removing abcd-ijk will not automatically remove
  "abcd-pqr-dev" package.

    sudo apt-get autoremove

Error in Removing a Debian Package:

  Sometimes we have to deal with errors while removing a debian package. When
  you get an error message while remove a debian package do the following: 

    Run Command:    dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq <package-name>
    Move Package:   mv /var/lib/dpkg/info/<package-name>.* /tmp/
