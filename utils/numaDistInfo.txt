Origins Of Numa Distance

The Numa distance exported by a system is obtained from CDIT tables
of ACPI. Numa distance is normalized to 10 or 1.0

Assume a system that has 3 nodes: A, B, C and following Numa distances:

A:A - 10, A:B - 20, A:C - 20
B:B - 10, B:A - 20, B:C - 20

C:C - 10, C:A - 20, C:B - 20

On such as a system accessing memory of node B or C from node A will be 2X
more expensive.


Q1. What is ACPI
A1. It stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface. This specification
    is a industry standard and allows BIOS to describe/encode system information.
    It was developed to enable operating system (OS) directed motherboard device
    configuration and power management of both devices and entire systems

Q2. What is SLIT
A2. It stands for System Locality Distance Information Table. It is an
    industry standard and is one of the tables exported by ACPI of a system

Q3. What is CDIT
A3. It stands for Component Distance Information Table. It extends SLIT by
    encoding information on devices such as GPU's.

Q4. Is CDIT an industry standard extension to ACPI
A4. It is NOT A industry standard. It is available only on AMD systems

Q5. Does CDIT replace SLIT instances in ACPI
A5. No. CDIT supplements information provided by SLIT. OS modules are able to
    get information from CDIT that is otherwise not accessible from SLIT,
    e.g. information on GPU's.
