How to mount a remote filesystem

Assume a folder on the remote machine: /home/<projName>
Assume user wants to mount on local system as: /home/<projName>
Command to mount /home/<projName> from remote machine to local machine is as follows:

sudo sshfs -o allow_other <userName>@<remoteMachine>:/home/<projName> /home/<projName>

@note: Strings in angle brackets are for illustration, substitute them with real names
@note: Sometimes one may have to use IP address instead of the name as the remote file server
