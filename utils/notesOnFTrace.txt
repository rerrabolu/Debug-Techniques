A tool that enables ftrace to be used in easy manner is "trace-cmd"
One can install that as: "sudo apt-get install trace-cmd"

It appears we can use this tool to capture calls to KFD and AMDGPU
functions. I am going to experiment and see what can be done.

Briefly one can get the list of kernel functions that can traced via
ftrace. The command to get the list is: "sudo trace-cmd list -f"

A simple dump shows about ~63,000 functions that can be captured via
ftrace. A filtering of these for amdgpu driver show about ~330 functions

To capture only calls to amdgpu module one can configure the run as
follows:  "echo '*:mod:amdgpu' > set_ftrace_filter"

This will ensure that ony calls to amdgpu will be logged.
