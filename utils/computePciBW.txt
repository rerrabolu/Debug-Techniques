Establish Known Parameters:

x.  Memory is 64-bit addressable

x.  Data to be sent 64 MB = 2^26

x.  MaxPayload = 256 bytes = 2^8

x.  Packet overhead is 32 bytes, per following schema

    Phy Layer Hdr "Start" - 4 bytes
      Data Link Layer Hdr "Sequence" - 2 bytes
        Transaction Layer Hdr "Header" -  12-16 bytes
        Transaction Layer Payload - 0-4096 bytes
        Transaction Layer Suffix "ECRC" - 4 bytes
      Data Link Layer Suffix "LCRC" - 4 bytes
    Sum Total = 32 bytes

x.  Link is running @ 8 Gb / sec
    @note: Ignoring 1.5 % loss due to symbol encoding
    This implies it take 1 nanosec to transmit 8 bits = 1 byte

x.  Number of lanes on device = 16 lanes
    Implies 16 * 1 bytes can be sent per nsec

Calculate TLP and DLLP Transfer Times

x.  Number of packets to transfer
    64 MB / 256 bytes = 2^26/2^8 = 2^18 = 256 K

x.  Time to transfer one Transaction Layer Packet (TLP)
    [(256 + 32) (data + pkt overhead) / 16 bytes/clock] * 1 nsec/clock
    
    288/16 = 18 clocks = 18 nsec
    
x.  Time taken to transfer 256K packets is
    2^18 * 18 nsec = 9 * 2^19 nsec = 9 * 512 * 2^10 nsec
    This is approximately 10 * 512 * 2^10 nsec = 4718592 nsec
    4718592 nsec = 4.7 millisec
    
x.  Time to transfer one Data Link Layer Packet (DLLP)
    To transfer a DLLP which is 8 bytes in size, it takes
      8 bytes / 16 bytes/clock = 1/2 clock = 0.5 nsec

Reasonable Assumptions About System Parameters:

x.  One DLLP Ack packet is sent for every 5 TLP's
    We have about 256K TLP. Therefore we need to send
    about 256K/5 = 51.2K packets.

x.  Time taken to send 51.2K ACK packets
    51.2K / 2 = 25.6K nsecs
 
x.  One DLLP FC packet is sent for every 4 TLP's
    We have about 256K TLP. Therefore we need to send
    about 256K/4 = 64K packets.

x.  Time taken to send 64K ACK packets
    64K / 2 = 32K nsecs

Calculate Bandwidth:

x.  Total bytes transferred = 64 MB = 2^26 bytes

x.  Transfer time:

         TLP Time: 256K * 18 nsec = 4.7 millisecs
    DLLP ACK Time: 25.6K * 1/2 nsec = 25.6K nsecs = 25.6 microsecs
     DLLP FC Time: 64K * 1/2 nsec = 32K nsecs = 32 microsec
       Total Time: 4757.6 microsecs = 4.756 millisecs
