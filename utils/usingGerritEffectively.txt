Using Gerrit Diff Effectivey:

Assume you have multiple patches - say 5

The base is always the unmodified version

When the URL ends with change list ID then it is a diff of the latest patch with the base
  Review URL - http...../<changeListId>
  e.g. http://....../36232351/

To do a diff between two patches simply specify the diff as follows:
  In this example I am doing a diff between patch version 3 and 4
  Review URL - http...../<changeListId>/<baseVersion>..<versionToCompare>
  e.g. http://....../36232351/3..4
  http://URL/#/c/xxx/yyy/zzz/+/371755/1..2 

To compare two versions of one file from a patch do something like following
  Review URL - http...../<changeListId>/<file-path-name>
  e.g. http://....../36232351/rocm_bandwidth_test.hpp
