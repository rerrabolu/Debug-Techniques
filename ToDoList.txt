Following is a brief list of small projects that would be helpful:

Project 1:

  A simple cmake build project
    Source code is distributed over multiple folders
    Source code exists at a depth of at least 2
    Build should build code of each folder as a static lib - e.g. "util.a"
    The master CMake file should do the following:
      Use the list "*.a" files and generate the output
      Be able to support generation of shared library "libFoo.so" file OR
        Be able to support generation of static library "libFoo.a" file

Project 2:
  
  A C++ Wrapper to allow tracing and other functionality to be easily built
  on top of existing C apis. Need to find out how to do this. How will it
  impact existing users.

Project 3:

  A standalone library to print function name, its parameters and return value
  The library shouldbe able to print names of api's and other data structures
  based o header files that are provided as input. For example, library will
  support a api to load a header file and after loading one or more header
  files it should allow the library to finalize them i.e. be able to print
  them.

Project 4:
  Need a simple script that will do the following:
    Use strace to launch an application
    Parse output to get the list of libraries application is using
    Parse output to get location of the libraries application is using
  
  Challenges:
    Get the strace option that will get the raw information
    Any option that minimizes the verbosity of the information dump
    Look for patterns that satisfy above criteria
