Getting Unmangled Name of Symbol:

Use of LD_DEBUG is described here - http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/blog/linux-ld-debug.html

Many times we encounter situations where the name of a symbol is reported as not found.

An example is given below:./BinarySearch: symbol lookup error:
  ...../lib/libhsa-runtime-tools64.so.1: undefined symbol: _ZTVN4core6SignalE

In such situations we would like to find its original name or one before it was demangled.
To do that use the tool c++filt

The man page on this is given here - https://linux.die.net/man/1/c++filt

Running c++filt on the above mangled symbol show it to be the vtable of core::Signal class.
