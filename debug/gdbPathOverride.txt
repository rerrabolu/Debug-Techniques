Gdb Debugging Source Path Override:

At the gdb prompt one can add the directory that has the files using the
command directory. For example lets say you want to step through code located
in file fool.c in folder Fool-1/Fool-2/Fool-3.

Do the following.

(gdb) directory <path of the folder that has fool.c>
(gdb) break fool.c:lineNumber or function name

When you run the gdb it will pick up the file automatically. One can use the entire
file tree to jump into, as long as the program is built with debug option.
