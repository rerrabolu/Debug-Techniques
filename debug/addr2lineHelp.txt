What are Segmentation Fault Messages:

A defined behavior where state of process being killed is
serialized for debugging later on

Location of Segmentation Fault Messages:

  One can check details of core dump in kernel's dmesg log
    grep for program in  /var/log/kern.log

Following is an example of a Segmentation Fault Messages.

  "rocm-bandwidth-[71562]: segfault at 0  \
        ip 00007f9aaf2d0bc3               \
        sp 00007ffee26b43e0 error 6 in    \
        libhsa-runtime64.so.1.1.30500[7f9aaf29a000+16d000]"

Interpreting Segmentation Fault Messages:
         Executable: rocm-bandwidth
         Process Id: 71562
         Fault Addr: 0
          Instr Ptr: 00007f9aaf2d0bc3
          Stack Ptr: 00007ffee26b43e0
         Error Code: 6
           Code Obj: libhsa-runtime64.so.1.1.30500
  Base Addr of Code: 7f9aaf29a000
   Size of Code Obj: 16d000

Find Code Location of SegFault:
  Get Segmentation Offset
    Subtract Base Addr of Code object from Instr Ptr
    faultOffset = 00007f9aaf2d0bc3 - 7f9aaf29a000 = 36bc3
 
Run Addr2line Tool:

addr2line -e <path-of-code-obj> -fCi  <faultOffset>

Experimental Results:

Introduced a deliberate segmentation fault in ROCr library
  Write to a NULL location

Following is the segmentation fault message

  "rocm-bandwidth-[71562]: segfault at 0      \
        ip 00007f9aaf2d0bc3                   \
        sp 00007ffee26b43e0 error 6 in        \
        libhsa-runtime64.so.1.1.30500[7f9aaf29a000+16d000]"

Running addr2line tool shows the error occuring in "amd::GpuAgent::InitRegionList()"

Log from Console:
